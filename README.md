This is a story of the NFL Draft Combine The NFL Draft Combine is an annual event where top prospects from college come to show athletic prowess at strictly staged events. 

The prospects are grouped by position and run through carefully planned drills to show athletic capability. Data is collected for key drills to provide the NFL teams with directly comparable data, and also provides players with an assessment of their overall athletic ability | This data represents the top 200 players drafted every year since 2001 (20 years). 

A key note...Some high value prospects choose to skip some events that provide no value to them and opt to perform the drills at their own college site, where they can have complete control over the drills. These are typically called 'Pro Days' and can account for missing data (outside this exercise. 


Skill Positions ('Skill') - Positions are grouped into skill to reduce the number of individual position names and alleviate inconsistencies in naming OLine - These are typically the largest, most massive players, and consequently the slowest (but strongest) - OG-(Offensive Guard) OT-Offensive Tackle, OL-Offensive Line, T-Tackle, C-Center DLine - Physically similar to OLine
